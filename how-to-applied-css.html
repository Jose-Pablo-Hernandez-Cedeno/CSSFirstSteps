    <h1>How to applied the CSS code to an html document</h1>
    
    <p>Before start seeing the specific properties by element and the different selector types, we'll see the 3 ways to applied the css code to an html document and where does it has to be inserted in each one, in addition to how does the property overrides works.</p>
    
    <section>
      <header><h2>The 3 Ways to insert CSS code</h2></header>     

      <article>
        <header><h3>CSS inline</h3></header>
        <p>In this way we only can use the declaration block's content syntax to create a single style rule that only applies to one single element.<br>
          
        To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute value can be any sequence of CSS declarations.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <header><h3>CSS internal</h3></header>
        <p>An internal style sheet only styles one single HTML page with any number of style rule.<br>

        The internal style rules are defined inside a &lt;style&gt; element, inside the head section.</p>
    </article>

      <article>
        <header><h3>CSS external</h3></header>
        <p>With an external style sheet, we can change the look of any html by changing just one file.<br>
  
        Each html page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the &lt;link&gt; element, inside the head section. We can do this by adding in that element the "href" attribute with a value of the .css file's URL and the "rel" attribute with the value: "stylesheet".</p>

    <section>
      <header><h2>Priority order of CSS code sources of different types</h2></header>

      <p>When there are multiple assignments for the same property from css codes of different types (inline/internal/external), the one that has the highest priority will override all the others.</p>
      
      <p>The priority order is the next, where the first has the lowest priority:
      <ol>
        <li>External and internal style sheets</li>
        <li>Inline style</li>
      </ol>
In the case of the style sheets, the order followed corresponds to the order of the &lt;link&gt; and &lt;style&gt; tags in the html document.</p>
      
      <p>This means that the styles in a page will <strong>"cascade"</strong> into a new "virtual" style sheet that corresponds to the screen shown result.</p>
