    <h1>Complex selectors</h1>

    <p>All complex selectors follow the next syntax:</p>

    <div class = "syntax_box">
      <div class = "heading_box">
        <span class = "heading">Syntax:</span>
      </div>
      <div class = "content_box">
        <span class = "content">Selector1 <span style = "color:blue">combinator1</span> Selector2 <span style = "color:blue">combinator2</span> ... <span style = "color:blue">combinatorN-1</span> <span style = "color:green">SelectorN</span></span>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Where each selector can be any compound selector and the <span style = "color:green"><strong>SelectorN</strong></span> is known as the <strong>key selector</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>A complex selector selects all the elements that simultaneously match the key selector and have a relationship, described by the last combinator, with an element that matches the compound/complex selector previous to that combinator.</p>
    
    <div class = "note">
      <p>Every combinator represents a specific relationship between two compound selectors, see each of them in the next lessons.</p>
    </div>
